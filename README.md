# Multi-Map
This is a simulation of a Professor's office hours schedule that runs 100 randomized trials and outputs the following: 
1) the average time a student spends waiting during an office hour visit, 
2) the average time a student spends with the professor during an office hour visit, and 
3) the average time a Professor spends at an office hour beyond the 1 hour he intended too in minutes. 

The purpose of this program was to implement the multi-map data structure with the key-value being the names of the students and the different amount of topics discussed in office hours. 
Furthermore, this program implements the capabilities of reading in text files and outputting the multi-map structure into one text file.
